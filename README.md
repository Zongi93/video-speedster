HTML5 video playback speedster
------------------------------

### How to install
This is a small chrome plugin, simply enable developer mode and then select the downloaded folder.

### How to use
Whenever a valid HTML element is present on the page, the plugins icon will light up, then upon clicking it will speed up all playback to 2.5 times the normal speed, but you can decrease/increase this with the numerical input (mouse hover->scroll also works).

### Disclaimer
This is just something I done in a few minutes, its not feature complete, nor will it probably ever be.
